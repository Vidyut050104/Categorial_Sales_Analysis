# Categorial_Sales_Analysis

➼ During my trainig program at FINLATICS , I consolidated and visualized sales, customer, and product data, which resulted in a 20% increase in sales and identifying areas that need improvement through data-driven promotional strategies.

➼ By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, I identified key segments and optimized marketing efforts, leading to a 15% improvement in customer retention rates. Additionally, the interactive dashboards provided real-time product analysis and also employee data analysis which helped understand employee efficiency, enhancing overall supply chain efficiency.

✅ Here's what I discovered:

## ✤ Task 1 - Framing Business Scenarios
I was given a dataset from a multinational technology business and learned to analyze the data and frame impactful visuals for the team. This exercise improved my data analysis and business analytical skills by spotting business trends.

## ✤ Task 2 - Creating Effective Visuals
I explored various techniques in Power BI to create engaging dashboards. Made use of navigation buttons and ETL methods to minimize my effort.

## ✤ Task 3 - Communicating Insights & Analysis
I identified areas for improvement and effectively conveyed findings and insights. This project emphasized the importance of clear communication in data visualization.
